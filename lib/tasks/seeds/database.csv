James Monaco,Film Theory & Criticism,Specific Films,How to Read A Film,"Richard Gilman referred to How to Read a Film as simply ""the best single work of its kind."" And Janet Maslin in The New York Times Book Review marveled at James Monaco's ability to collect ""an enormous amount of useful information and assemble it in an exhilaratingly simple and systematic way."" Indeed, since its original publication in 1977, this hugely popular book has become the definitive source on film and media. Now, James Monaco offers a special anniversary edition of his classic work, featuring a new preface and several new sections, including an ""Essential Library: One Hundred Books About Film and Media You Should Read"" and ""One Hundred Films You Should See."" As in previous editions, Monaco once again looks at film from many vantage points, as both art and craft, sensibility and science, tradition and technology. After examining film's close relation to other narrative media such as the novel, painting, photography, television, and even music, the book discusses the elements necessary to understand how films convey meaning, and, more importantly, how we can best discern all that a film is attempting to communicate. In addition, Monaco stresses the still-evolving digital context of film throughout--one of the new sections looks at the untrustworthy nature of digital images and sound--and his chapter on multimedia brings media criticism into the twenty-first century with a thorough discussion of topics like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the proximity of both to film.  With hundreds of illustrative black-and-white film stills and diagrams, How to Read a Film is an indispensable addition to the library of everyone who loves the cinema and wants to understand it better.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9780195321050/how-to-read-a-film.jpg,39.9,736,Oxford University Press,2009-05-01,23.4 x 16.5 x 3.8,Computer Hardware
"Noam Nisan,Shimon Schocken",Computer Science,Computing & I.T.,The Elements of Computing Systems,"In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software, compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, ""The Elements of Computing Systems"" gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system. Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture. Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience. The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9780262640688/the-elements-of-computing-systems.jpg,50.95,344,MIT Press Ltd,2008-03-31,22.9 x 20.4 x 1.8,Computer Hardware

Nick Bostrom,Risk Assessment,Decision Theory,Superintelligence,"The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains.If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence. This profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9780198739838/superintelligence.jpg,19.95,390,Oxford University Press,2016-04-14,19.6 x 12.9 x 2.3,Computer Science

The Future of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the 'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face interaction.  The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's professionals.

Nicholas Carr,Impact of Science & Technology on Society,Science in General,The Shallows,"“Is Google making us stupid?” When Nicholas Carr posed that question, in a celebrated Atlantic Monthly cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the Internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net’s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet’s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by “tools of the mind”—from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer—Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways. Building on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic—a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption—and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection. Part intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes—Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive—even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche. This is a book that will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9780393339758/the-shallows.jpg,20.75,304,WW Norton & Co,2011-06-06,21.1 x 14.0 x 2.0,Computer Science

Garry Kasparov,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science,Deep Thinking,"In May 1997, the world watched as Garry Kasparov, the greatest chess player in the world, was defeated for the first time by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. It was a watershed moment in the history of technology: machine intelligence had arrived at the point where it could best human intellect.It wasn't a coincidence that Kasparov became the symbol of man's fight against the machines. Chess has long been the fulcrum in development of machine intelligence; the hoax automaton 'The Turk' in the 18th century and Alan Turing's first chess program in 1952 were two early examples of the quest for machines to think like humans -- a talent we measured by their ability to beat their creators at chess. As the pre-eminent chessmaster of the 80s and 90s, it was Kasparov's blessing and his curse to play against each generation's strongest computer champions, contributing to their development and advancing the field. Like all passionate competitors, Kasparov has taken his defeat and learned from it. He has devoted much energy to devising ways in which humans can partner with machines in order to produce results better than either can achieve alone. During the twenty years since playing Deep Blue, he's played both with and against machines, learning a great deal about our vital relationship with our most remarkable creations. Ultimately, he's become convinced that by embracing the competition between human and machine intelligence, we can spend less time worrying about being replaced and more thinking of new challenges to conquer.In this breakthrough book, Kasparov tells his side of the story of Deep Blue for the first time -- what it was like to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent -- the mistakes he made and the reasons the odds were against him. But more than that, he tells his story of AI more generally, and how he's evolved to embrace it, taking part in an urgent debate with philosophers worried about human values, programmers creating self-learning neural networks, and engineers of cutting edge robotics.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9781473653511/deep-thinking.jpg,21.95,304,Hodder & Stoughton General Division,2018-04-05,19.7 x 12.9 x 1.9,Computer Science

Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flip side. Criminals are often the earliest, and most innovative, adopters of technology and modern times have led to modern crimes. Today's criminals are stealing identities, draining online bank-accounts and wiping out computer servers.  It's disturbingly easy to activate baby cam monitors to spy on families, pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt, and thieves are analyzing your social media in order to determine the best time for a home invasion. Meanwhile, 3D printers produce AK-47s, terrorists can download the recipe for the Ebola virus, and drug cartels are building drones. This is just the beginning of the tsunami of technological threats coming our way.

Too often, outdated standards of control and privacy force us into unfair contracts with data companies, but it doesn't have to be this way. Weigend makes a powerful argument that we need to take control of how our data is used to actually make it work for us. Only then can we the people get back more from Big Data than we give it.

"Frank M. Ahearn,Eileen C. Horan",Privacy & Data Protection,Computer Security,How to Disappear,"From the world's preeminent people finderan insider's guide to disappearing How to Disappear is the authoritative and comprehensive guide for people who seek to protect their privacy as well as for anyone who’s ever entertained the fantasy of disappearingwhether actually dropping out of sight or by eliminating the traceable evidence of their existence. Written by the world’s leading experts on finding people and helping people avoid being found, How to Disappear covers everything from tools for disappearing to discovering and eliminating the nearly invisible tracks and clues we tend to leave wherever we go. Learn the three keys to disappearing, all about your electronic footprints, the dangers and opportunities of social networking sites, and how to disappear from a stalker. Frank Ahearn and Eileen Horan provide field-tested methods for maintaining privacy, as well as tactics and strategies for protecting personal information and preventing identity theft. They explain and illustrate key tactics such as misinformation (destroying all the data known about you); disinformation (creating fake trails); and, finally, reformationthe act of getting you from point A to point B without leaving clues. Ahearn illustrates every step with real-life stories of his fascinating career, from undercover work to nab thieving department store employees to a stint as a private investigator; and, later, as a career skip tracer” who finds people who don’t want to be found. In 1997, when news broke of President Bill Clinton’s dalliance with a White House intern, Ahearn was hired to find her. When Oscar statuettes were stolen in Beverly Hills, Ahearn pinpointed a principal in the caper to help solve the case. When Russell Crowe threw a telephone at a hotel clerk in 2005, Ahearn located the victim and hid him from the media. An indispensable resource not just for those determined to become utterly anonymous, but also for just about anyone in the brave new world of on-line information, How to Disappear sums up Ahearn’s dual philosophy: Don’t break the law, but know how to protect yourself.  AN EXCERPT: How Not to DisappearThere are several books and Web sites that explain how to obtain a new identity. If you are a not a criminal or international spy, you do not need a new identity to safely and discretely disappear. . . . What people fail to take into consideration is how they can test out their new identity. Do you book a trip internationally and just wing it past customs? Do you speed in your car and wait 'til you get pulled over and have the cop run your new license? Perhaps you walk into a Social Security office with your birth certificate and apply for a Social Security number at the age of thirty-five and explain you have been living in a cave for the past twenty years? . . . New identities are a bad idea. Imagine that you are now Mr. Vincent Vega from Palm Springs, and you’re hanging out with your lady friend and her family sipping Pina Coladas and over walks your best friend from high school. This dumb nut starts calling you by your real name, Dexter Plaidpants. Just try explaining that to all at the tablecover blown.

Your online and in-store purchasing patterns are recorded, and reveal if you're unemployed, sick, or pregnant. Your e-mails and texts expose your intimate and casual friends. Google knows what you’re thinking because it saves your private searches. Facebook can determine your sexual orientation without you ever mentioning it.The powers that surveil us do more than simply store this information. Corporations use surveillance to manipulate not only the news articles and advertisements we each see, but also the prices we’re offered. Governments use surveillance to discriminate, censor, chill free speech, and put people in danger worldwide. And both sides share this information with each other or, even worse, lose it to cybercriminals in huge data breaches.Much of this is voluntary: we cooperate with corporate surveillance because it promises us convenience, and we submit to government surveillance because it promises us protection. The result is a mass surveillance society of our own making. But have we given up more than we’ve gained? In Data and Goliath, security expert Bruce Schneier offers another path, one that values both security and privacy. He brings his bestseller up-to-date with a new preface covering the latest developments, and then shows us exactly what we can do to reform government surveillance programs, shake up surveillance-based business models, and protect our individual privacy.

"Douglas W. Hubbard,Richard Seiersen,Daniel E. Geer, Jr.,Stuart McClure",Business & Management,Non-Fiction,How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk,"How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk exposes the shortcomings of current ""risk management"" practices, and offers a series of improvement techniques that help you fill the holes and ramp up security. In his bestselling book How to Measure Anything, author Douglas W. Hubbard opened the business world's eyes to the critical need for better measurement. This book expands upon that premise and draws from The Failure of Risk Management to sound the alarm in the cybersecurity realm. Some of the field's premier risk management approaches actually create more risk than they mitigate, and questionable methods have been duplicated across industries and embedded in the products accepted as gospel. This book sheds light on these blatant risks, and provides alternate techniques that can help improve your current situation. You'll also learn which approaches are too risky to save, and are actually more damaging than a total lack of any security. ",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9781119085294/how-to-measure-anything-in-cybersecurity-risk.jpg,56.5,304,John Wiley & Sons Inc,2016-07-15,23.62 x 16.0 x 2.54,Computer Security

Glenn Greenwald,Espionage & Secret Services,International Relations,No Place to Hide,"In May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the 29-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy. As the arguments rage on and the government considers various proposals for reform, it is clear that we have yet to see the full impact of Snowden's disclosures.Now for the first time, Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity ten-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for ""The Guardian,"" and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with never-before-seen documents entrusted to him by Snowden himself.Going beyond NSA specifics, Greenwald also takes on the establishment media, excoriating their habitual avoidance of adversarial reporting on the government and their failure to serve the interests of the people. Finally, he asks what it means both for individuals and for a nation's political health when a government pries so invasively into the private lives of its citizens--and considers what safeguards and forms of oversight are necessary to protect democracy in the digital age. Coming at a landmark moment in American history, ""No Place to Hide"" is a fearless, incisive, and essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9781250062581/no-place-to-hide.jpg,20.25,304,Picador USA,2015-04-28,23.1 x 15.5 x 2.3,Computer Security

With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home commmputers.Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as ""the Hacker Ethick,"" that still thrives today. Hackers caputers a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.""If you want to change the world in some big way, that's where you should start---biological molecules.

Jeremy Swinfen Green,Business & Management,Non-Fiction,The Weakest Link,"The Weakest Link looks at one of the biggest issues in cyber security: how to protect organisations from their own employees. Many cyber threats don't involve hackers using clever software to penetrate company networks; threats can often involve employees acting in ways that, accidentally or deliberately, leak information or damage assets without a hacker being involved at all. Emerging technologies and behavioural changes - driven by cloud computing and people using their own smartphones and tablets for work - are starting to make these threats more common and far more serious.Written to help anyone understand how information security has become the responsibility of individual employees, it shows exactly what they can do to protect company systems and data. Effective solutions need to go beyond simple security awareness and show how to create a complete culture of security. Individuals can then use this learned behaviour to keep themselves digitally safe at work and in their personal lives.

Kim Zetter,Politics & Government,Non-Fiction,Countdown To Zero Day,"Top cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter tells the story behind the virus that sabotaged Iran’s nuclear efforts and shows how its existence has ushered in a new age of warfare—one in which a digital attack can have the same destructive capability as a megaton bomb.    In January 2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency noticed that centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery—apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them.    Then, five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred: A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly.    At first, the firm’s programmers believed the malicious code on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a mysterious virus of unparalleled complexity.    They had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the world’s first digital weapon. For Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: Rather than simply hijacking targeted computers or stealing information from them, it escaped the digital realm to wreak actual, physical destruction on a nuclear facility.     In these pages, Wired journalist Kim Zetter draws on her extensive sources and expertise to tell the story behind Stuxnet’s planning, execution, and discovery, covering its genesis in the corridors of Bush’s White House and its unleashing on systems in Iran—and telling the spectacular, unlikely tale of the security geeks who managed to unravel a sabotage campaign years in the making.    But Countdown to Zero Day ranges far beyond Stuxnet itself. Here, Zetter shows us how digital warfare developed in the US. She takes us inside today’s flourishing zero-day “grey markets,” in which intelligence agencies and militaries pay huge sums for the malicious code they need to carry out infiltrations and attacks. She reveals just how vulnerable many of our own critical systems are to Stuxnet-like strikes, from nation-state adversaries and anonymous hackers alike—and shows us just what might happen should our infrastructure be targeted by such an attack.    Propelled by Zetter’s unique knowledge and access, and filled with eye-opening explanations of the technologies involved, Countdown to Zero Day is a comprehensive and prescient portrait of a world at the edge of a new kind of war.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9780770436193/countdown-to-zero-day.jpg,18.95,448,Broadway Books (A Division of Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc),2015-09-01,20.0 x 13.1 x 2.4,Computer Security

Jon Duckett,Computer Programming & Software Development,Computing & I.T.,"Web Design with HTML, Css, JavaScript and Jquery Set","HTML & CSS: Designing and Building Web Sites teaches readers the basics of HTML and CSS. This book is unique because it throws away dull templates and presents the information in full color, with the use of helpful info-graphics. It starts by introducing structure and hierarchy rather than jumping with the first elements or how websites work. Since a picture can often tell a thousand words, the book introduces each new element in a visual way, relying on images and diagrams rather than pages of text. It then goes on to discuss CSS, and teaches the reader how to control how their pages will look / appear. As a value-add, the book is accompanied by a website that the user can download to their computer with lots of examples and exercises to try for themselves. The book covers: structure, text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, useful options, adding style w/CSS, controlling fonts, colors, thinking in boxes, styling lists, styling tables, layouts, using grids, and offers practical advice about SEO, Google analytics, ftp, and HTML5 all in beautifully rendered 4-color ease of reading. The reader will learn:  How pages are structured How to create text How to create lists Linking between pages on a site Adding images to a page Structure and creation of tables Elements of forms and how to create How to add style with CSS Controlling fonts Adding colors Layouts  JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Development takes a far more visual approach than other titles in the topical area, with lots of diagrams, infographics, and lifestyle photography, following the same format as HTML & CSS (design and build websites). The audience of that title has already shown a strong interest in a book on JavaScript in this format. Unlike the majority of books on JavaScript or JQuery, this title covers both (because JQuery makes it easier and faster to develop your own scripts), and it does not assume experience of either of these technologies. It will make use of some popular JQuery plugins to illustrate techniques that would otherwise require many pages of detailed explanation (if the reader were being taught to create the plugins from scratch themselves). By explaining how it works, we can use fewer pages and still explain the same core concepts (simultaneously showing readers how to use JQuery plugins rather than writing scripts from scratch). The book explains the jargon of programming clearly and simply to those who do not understand the vocabulary (rather than pretending to be jargon-free), which is important because the reader does need to know these terms if they are to understand how to use many of the JQuery plugins available and understand their documentation. Along the way, the book will include many pro-tips to attract the attention of people who already know a bit of JavaScript and make them feel like they are still learning something new. The book also has some very timely features (not covered in competing titles) including:  Mentions of CSS transforms where they are a good alternative to JavaScript Responsive design techniques Using JavaScript to serve images for Retina displays.   ",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9781118907443/web-design-with-html-css-javascript-and-jquery-set.jpg,59.25,1152,John Wiley & Sons Inc,2014-06-20,23.37 x 18.8 x 5.9,Software Development

Michael Freeman,Photographic Equipment & Techniques,Photography & Photographs,The Photographer's Eye,"Design is the single most important factor in creating a successful   photograph. The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and   then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling   composition has always been one of the key skills in making  photographs.  Of course, digital photography has brought a new, exciting  aspect to  design  first because the instant feedback from a digital  camera allows  immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because  image-editing  tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design  after the shutter  has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on  the way digital  photographers take pictures. The Photographer's Eye  shows how anyone can  develop an eye for seeing great digital photos.  The book explores all  the traditional approaches to composition and  design, but crucially, it  also addresses the new digital technique of  shooting in the knowledge  that a picture will later be edited,  manipulated, or montaged to result  in a final image that may be very  different from the one seen in the viewfinder.",https://www.booktopia.com.au/http_coversbooktopiacomau/big/9781781574553/the-photographer-s-eye.jpg,26.95,192,Octopus Publishing Group,2017-07-11,25.5 x 23.7 x 1.4,Software Development
